`server.js` hosts an HTTP and WebSocket server for the client to connect to. It also handles communicating with the Spotify API. To use the Spotify API, a client secret from your Spotify application is used. This is done by reading from a file named `CLIENT_SECRET` in this repository's directory. Create this file and paste in your client secret.
